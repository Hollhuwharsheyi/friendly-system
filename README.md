# Malaria, one of the most common life-threatening diseases, take for instance, in Africa. It is caused by a single-celled parasite from plasmodium. When a person contracts this parasite, the liver becomes infected first, followed by the red blood cells. If the malaria parasite is not properly diagnosed and treated in its early stages, it might lead to severe illness and even death. Detecting malaria becomes challenging when a lot of symptoms are present, and inadequate approach is used. Hence there is need for efficient prediction of the malaria parasite in the human body to aid early treatment. This report presents two prediction model, a multilayer perceptron neural network with ReLU activation function and Radial basis function for predicting severity of Plasmodium Falciparum parasite into acute malaria levels using 18 features extracted from 1000 observations. Dataset of malaria parasite patients is sourced from Kaggle. The work is implemented in Python. The performance of the techniques is evaluated based on mean square error (MSE), confusion matrix, checking for the Accuracy and the classification report. A comparative evaluation of the multilayer perceptron model using ReLU function and radial basis function model is carried out and results obtained shows Multi-layer Perceptron having an overall accuracy rate of 0.7% compared to Radial Basis Function accuracy rate 0.65%.
